Intent: Account for extra minutes for time tracking program

-- Details ------
Currently the time tracking program only counts time to 0.25 hours and will
round after a specific cutoff is reached. This is to match it with
like-software.

However, usually the total time worked is not a multiple of 0.25 and is often
more. The program should be able to track those extra minutes and when they add
up to a multiple of 0.25, add them to the relevant sheet.

-- Example input ------
Start	  End	  Total	Rounded	Difference
07:09	 16:01  08:22	 08:15     6
07:09	 16:01  08:22	 08:15     7
07:09	 15:54	08:15	 08:15     0
07:09	 16:01	08:22	 08:15     6 <--- 6+7+6 = 19. Put 15 minutes and remember 4
07:09	 15:56	08:17	 08:15     1
07:09	 16:05	08:26	 08:30    -5

-- Solution(s) ------
When calculating regular time (multiples of 0.25) calculate "unclaimed mins"
by taking the difference. Store the unclaimed mins as it's own value in the
save file and data record.
Will need somewhere to store 'remainder' each time number of minutes is calc'd

- Calculating extra minutes -
Input: Start date, End date, remainder
For each entry in the given period, sum up total unclaimed minutes
Add remainder from previous calculation
Convert to multiple of 0.25. Set remainder to whatever is left

-> Will need to remember which minutes have been claimed

2) ??
Limit calculations to the current fiscal year (max 365, O(365))
Whenever a change is made to a relevant field (start or end time)
  recalculate accumulated time for every following entry until the end of the
  fiscal year.

-- Steps to take -----
1. Update data record to handle extra field
2. Update load function to handle extra field (but also work w/out it)
3. Update save function to handle extra field
4+ Add functionality for calculating and summing extra minutes
